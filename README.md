# HelloHolo
HoloLens application for floor plan survey using Microsoft's virtual reality glasses.

Worked on in with a colleague during Microsoft's HoloLens hackathon. We created a VR floor plan survey application where you can 'shot' walls and various elements in the real world using commands and gestures.  
You can place different objects as well and openings in the walls.

My code (not plugins) is inside Assets/Scripts folder
